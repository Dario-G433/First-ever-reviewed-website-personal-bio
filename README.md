After only beginning my web development journey in March, this personal bio website has provided evidence that consistency over time yields results. Still having a lot to 
learn practicing how to program instead of just copying code had given me the capacity to create a website that gives a little 
information about myself, and have a good layout despite not fully finishing my HTML/CSS journey or even lerning javascript.
